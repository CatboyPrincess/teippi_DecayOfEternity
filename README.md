# Teippi
Bw modhack thingy which removes several limits from the game and makes it run faster

# Building
Python 3 is required to run the build script and currently gcc/clang are the only supported compilers.

Run `python waf configure` followed by `python waf` to build the plugin. The resulting file will be in build\teippi.qdp.

For compile options, see `python waf --help`
